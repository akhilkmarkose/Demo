It's time to actually land a Job. 

I have decided myself to follow some strict rules until I am able to find an employment:

1. Practice the DS and Algorithms's daily for 45 mins
2. Work on a Programming language for at lest 45 mins
3. Listen to a lot of IT Interviews, both technical and HR.
4. Constantly look for better opportunities at some of the popular Job portals like Linkedin, indeed etc..
5. Prepare a resume, that looks attractive and start submitting application against the opportunities available.
